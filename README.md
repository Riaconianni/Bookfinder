# Bookfinder App

## Group Project 2

### Project Description

Goal: for this project, we decided to create an app where a user can log into a database with a username and password.

To access the app, go to: https://quiet-basin-62546.herokuapp.com/

### Project Outline

There are 2 HTML pages that we used for the site: `index.html` and `books.html`.

The first page (`index.html`) contains a form where the user has to log in with a username and password. 

After the user logs in, they are redirected to a second page (`books.html`), which contains a database for books. Here the user will see a list of their favorite books.

The user can then add a new book to the list by clicking `add a new book to the list` which will then ask for the following fields:
  -title
  -author
  -description

The user then hits the submit button, and the book gets added to the list of books.

From the list of books, the user can click on each book and see its name, author, and description.

If a user decides to erase a book, they can click on the book on the list and then click the big red x below it.
